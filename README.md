# ImagiZoo
Image matching Deep Dream concept webapp of Zoo Animals

Idea was to partner with the St. Louis Zoo in some capactiy.
The game works by taking a Deep Dream modified image of an animal and asking the player to choose which animal the picture is of, from a set of four choices.
At the time we had to manually create each deep dream image, ideally this step would be modified, and Zoo guests would be able to submit their own images to the game's database.
